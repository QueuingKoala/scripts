Scripts Readme
==============

This is my "Scripts" project that holds a collection of assorted scripts for
various tasks.

Each directory here groups the scripts within loosely according to either
high-level task (when multiple are related or call each-other) or by intended
installation directory (eg: ~/bin/.) Since these are often small targeted
scripts, the location may not be that informative.

Licensing
=========

Unless otherwise noted, all the files in this project are licensed under a BSD
3-clause license.

If a script header has a different license arrangement, **that header takes
priority** and you should assume it is not available under a BSD license unless
explicitly stated.
